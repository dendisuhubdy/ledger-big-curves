# BIP 39 performance evaluation for Ledger Blue 

This application demonstrates how a user application can re-implement a specific BOLOS cryptographic algorithm for speed optimizations, reducing BIP 39 mnemonic derivation time from 1 minute to 6 seconds by using less generic code and specific compiler optimizations.

After installing and running the application, you can launch demo.py to evaluate the speed of both implementations
